# Keycloak SSO & OID4VC Demo

This project is a React application that demonstrates how to integrate Keycloak for Single Sign-On (SSO) and interact with an OID4VC (OpenID for Verifiable Credentials) service. It provides a basic setup for user authentication and a protected dashboard page.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Login and logout functionality using Keycloak SSO.
- **Protected Routes:** A dashboard page that is only accessible to authenticated users.
- **OID4VC Integration:** A service to interact with an OID4VC provider.
- **Modern Tech Stack:** Built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager
- A running Keycloak instance with a configured realm and client.

### Installation
