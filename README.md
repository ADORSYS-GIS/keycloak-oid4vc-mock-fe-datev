## Features

- **User Authentication:** Login and logout functionality using Keycloak SSO.
- **Protected Routes:** A dashboard page that is only accessible to authenticated users.
- **OID4VC Integration:** A service to interact with an OID4VC provider.
- **Modern Tech Stack:** Built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.
